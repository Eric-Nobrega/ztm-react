react notes

react uses a declarative approach. it utilises a component architecture, this
combined with state and prop, help to achieve reusable and simple code.

data flow
in react, data flows in one direction, from the top to the bottom. through the
use of call back functions, we can pass data from bottom to top.

componentOne(callBackFunc(componentTwo))
componentTwo(callBackFunc())

class components vs functional components

older react codebases tend to use class components, however,
since the introduction of functional componnets, modern react codebases will 
favor functional components to class components

main differences between class components vs functional components:
    -> functional components allow for the use of react hooks
    -> functional components do not have access to a render function, they
       simply return the jsx/html code
    -> functional components will accept props as an arguement
    -> functional components are sometimes called stateless components, this is
       because class components are able to set the state within the component,
       whereas functional components are not able to do this, however, using
       hooks it is now possible
    -> class components will use the render() function that will then return the
       jsx/html code
    -> class components have access to use props, aswell as setting the state
